- 👋 Hi, I’m Byunghwan 'Ben' Son (@textvulture), Associate Professor of Global Affairs at George Mason University.
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself automated text analysis and applied causal inference.

- 👨‍💻 I think GitHub is great. I never learned anything about R, Latex, or Markdown in my graduate training. Nobody around me seemed to know them, let alone use them. So I've taught myself those things. GitHub makes this self-teaching easier--I can just sit on the shoulders of smart people.
